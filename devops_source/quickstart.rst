**NOTE: the User Guide portion of this documentation has been superseded by**
`../../userguide/html <../../userguide/html>`_ and no further updates will be made here.
This page documents the **backend / implementation** of the system; users should
instead refer to
https://code.harvard.edu/pages/HBS/rcs__cluster_software_modules/userguide/html
or access the *Technology Preview software environment help* on the HBS Grid.

This documentation describes **Technology Preview** conda environments and other software
installed and maintained on the `HBS Grid <https://grid.rcs.hbs.org/>`_ by
`RCS <https://inside.hbs.edu/Departments/rcs/Pages/default.aspx>`_. The software
documented here is **a technology preview** and **any and all use is at your own risk**.
