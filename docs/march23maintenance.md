# HBSGrid Maintenance 3/13/23

Our next maintenance is scheduled for <strong>Monday, March 13, 8 AMâ€“12 PM</strong>.</p>
<p><em>During the maintenance window:</em>
<ul>
<li>You will not be able to log in to the HBSGrid via terminal or NoMachine.</li>
<li>All interactive jobs and disconnected NoMachine sessions will be terminated.</li>
</ul></p>
<p><em>What work is being performed and why? </em>
<ul>
<li>We will apply security patches to login, Globus, and queue nodes. <strong>These changes ensure the safety and stability of our environment. </strong></li>
<li>We will apply bug fixes to address problems with LSF when using GPUs. <strong>This will fix some bugs and ensure that we have access to continuing support.</strong></li>
</ul></p>
