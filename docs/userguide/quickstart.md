This guide shows how to quickly get up and running on the HBS Grid.

## Prerequisites
    
To get started you must have an
[HBS Grid account](../support/account-requests.md)
and be connected to the HBS network, either directly if you are on-campus or
[connect via VPN](https://www.hbs.edu/research-computing-services/Shared%20Documents/Grid/two-step_vpn_qrg_updated_pdf_1.pdf)
otherwise. You must also have the 
[NoMachine Enterprise Client](https://www.nomachine.com/download-enterprise#NoMachine-Enterprise-Client)
remote desktop application installed on your computer.

## Connect and enable software environments

Once you have an account and are connected to the HBS network, follow this
simple procedure to connect to our research computing environment:

!!! example

    1.  Log in to the HBS Grid by using
        [NoMachine](https://www.nomachine.com/download-enterprise#NoMachine-Enterprise-Client)
        to connect to host `hbsgrid-nx.hbs.edu`
     
    2.  A welcome dialog will appear asking you to select a computing environment.
        Choose *HBS Grid 3.0* and click *OK*.

A selection of our most popular applications are available in the favorites list
pinned to the task-bar. Additional application launchers can be found in the
Applications menu or by searching in Activities. You can add applications to
your favorites list by right-clicking and selecting Add to Favorites.

## Next steps

This environment was designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, and
you are encouraged to start exploring the available software and tools. If you
are doing real work you will probably want to refer to [Mount Drives and Copy
Data](syncfiles.md) to learn how to get your data onto the HBS Grid. Additional
documentation is available if you need it, including the [Launch
Applications from the Desktop](menulaunch.md) and [Start Jobs from the
Terminal](commandline.md) sections.
