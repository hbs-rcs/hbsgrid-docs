# HBS [Research Computing Services](https://www.hbs.edu/research-computing-services) provides user-friendly environments to bring the massive computing power of the HBS Grid to the whole HBS research community. Our environments offer a **familiar desktop interface** and **configured software applications** including *Julia*, *Jupyterlab*, *Matlab*, *Python*, *R / Rstudio*, *Stata*, *VSCode*, and hundreds of other popular programs

The HBS Grid consists of many powerful computers connected by a fast
network and shared network storage. These machines have up to 1.4Tb of
memory and up to 32 cores each and together they provide the backbone
of HBS's research computing capabilities. This powerful network of
computers can be accessed via user-friendly tools and environments,
making the power of our computing cluster accessible to all HBS researchers.
Using the HBS Grid you can:

- Interactively analyze data too large for local memory.
- Speed up your analysis using hundreds of CPUs across multiple machines.
- Access your persistent remote desktop from anywhere with an internet connection.
- Store, backup, and access large research data.
- Share data and collaborate with HBS affiliates and guests.

These environments are in active development and are currently
available as a *Technology Preview* for testing.

**User testing and project status**

We are currently conducting user testing and assessing the possibility
of making this software more widely available. The environment is
generally stable but the software documented here 
**remains a technology preview and any and all use is at your own risk**.

If you find that something doesn't work as expected, of if you have a
feature request, we would love to know about it so we can fix or improve
it. Bug reports and feature requests are important contributions to this
project and are always welcome and encouraged! You can either start a
discussion at <https://github.com/hbs-rcs/hbsgrid-docs/discussions> or create an issue
report at <https://github.com/hbs-rcs/hbsgrid-docs/issues>. We are building a
friendly and welcoming community of HBS Grid users and we invite you to
join us using the links above.
