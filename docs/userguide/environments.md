A huge range of software applications, utilities, and libraries are
installed and configured for you. Whether you need *Rstudio* or
*Spyder*, *Julia* running in *VSCode*, popular R or Python packages,
of fully configured *Jupyter Notebooks*, we have you covered.

---

## Available software

The list of installed software is so large we make no effort to
enumerate everything here, but you can always get an up-to-date list
by opening a *terminal* on the Grid and running
``` sh
conda list
```

**Start with the expectation that all the software you need is already
installed and ready to use**. If that expectation is ever broken please
put in a request using our [discussion forum](https://github.com/hbs-rcs/hbsgrid-docs/discussions)
or [issue tracker](https://github.com/hbs-rcs/hbsgrid-docs/issues).

## Using older software environments from the desktop

Each time we update our software environments we preserve previous
versions so that you can roll back for reproducibility or if your code
stops working after an update. This section details the specific
software environment versions available.

As an illustration of the benefits of preserving historical software
environments, imagine that you have a python project and that your
*Pandas* code no longer works with the latest *Pandas* release in the
current software environment. In that case you can start *Spyder* and 
revert to a previous software environment in order to run your analysis 
using an older version of *Pandas*. The screen-shot below shows how to 
use the Software environment version selector to run and older version of
*python*.

![](imgs/switchEnvironment.png){.media .media-block}

Software environments are named following a `rcs_year.version` scheme.
For example, the first environment released in 2021 is named
`rcs_2021.01`. The list below shows you key information about each
environment, including a command that you can run from the terminal to
get a detailed software version list.

## Using older software environments from the terminal

In order to facilitate reproducible research and analysis we preserve old software
environments so that you can switch back to them later if needed. These older
environments can be loaded using [Lmod](https://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/010_user.html).

Running
``` sh
ml avail
```
will show you the available environments, named by date and version number.

For example, suppose that you have a python project and that your pandas code no
longer works with the latest pandas release in the current software environment.
In that case you can revert to a previous software environment and run your
analysis using an older version of pandas.

You can use the `ml` command from the terminal to *list*, *load*, and *unload* Lmod environment,
as shown below.

``` contents
      ml avail
      
        -------------- /usr/local/app/rcs_bin/techpreview-dev/modulefiles --------------
        rcs/rcs_2020.01 (E)    rcs/rcs_2021.01 (E)    rcs/rcs_2021.03 (E,L,D)


        Where:
        D:  Default Module
        E:  Experimental
        L:  Module is loaded
        
        Use "module spider" to find all possible modules.
        Use "module keyword key1 key2 ..." to search for all possible modules matching
        any of the "keys".
```

You can get detailed information about specific software modules using the
`ml spyder` command:

``` contents
      module spyder rcs/rcs_2021.03
      
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        rcs: rcs/rcs_2021.03
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Description:
        Conda environment for research computing
        
        Help:
        Sets up environment for Data Science and Statistical computing.
        
        A huge list of software is avalable, including 'python', 'spyder', 'R', 
        'rstudio', 'emacs', 'vscode', rclone, ripgrep, nnn and much more.
        
        Key software versions:
        
        libgcc-ng 9
        cudatoolkit 10.1
        tensorflow-gpu 2.2
        python 3.8
        jupyterlab 3.0
        numpy 1.20
        pandas 1.2
        r-base 4.0
        r-tidyverse 1.3
        sas 9.4
        stata 16
        octave 6.2
        mathematica 12
        matlab R2020a
        emacs 27.1
        QGIS 3.16
        
        For a detailed software list open a terminal and run 
        
        conda env export -n rcs_2021.03
```

Finally you can use `ml` to load and unload specific environments.
``` sh
ml rcs_2021.03
```
will load the *rcs_2021.03* environment, and 
``` sh
ml -rcs_2021.03
```
will unload it.

Detailed [Lmod documentation is available here](https://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and you can learn more about the environments available on the HBS Grid in the [Environments documentation](environments.md).


## Software environment versions

Current and historical software environments are described below.

### rcs_2022.01

After more than 6 months of hard work, the 
[HBS grid technology preview software environment](https://hbs-rcs.github.io/hbsgrid-docs/)
version 2022.01 was released in January 2022! This environment 
**remains a technology preview and any and all use is at your own risk**.

This *technology preview* software environment is a user-friendly set of
software and utilities designed to make data science and statistics
easier for HBS Grid users. If you have not yet done so, you can try it
by following the [quick-start guide](quickstart.md).

If you are already using the technology preview environment you will
be prompted to upgrade next time you log in to the HBS Grid. As always
you can continue using previous versions if needed, as described in
the [environments documentation](environments.md).

In this release we have added a large number of new statistics and
data science applications and packages, including:

-   [JASP](https://jasp-stats.org/ "https://jasp-stats.org/"), a free
    menu-driven statistics application similar to SPSS
-   [Cytoscape](https://cytoscape.org/ "https://cytoscape.org/"), an
    open source software platform for visualizing complex networks,
-   [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/ "https://duckdb.org/"), an in-process
    SQL OLAP database management system
-   [texminer](https://www.rtextminer.com/ "https://www.rtextminer.com/"),
    functions for text mining and topic modeling in R
-   [Dedupe](https://docs.dedupe.io/en/latest/ "https://docs.dedupe.io/en/latest/"),
    a library that uses machine learning to perform de-duplication and
    entity resolution in Python
-   [awscli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/ "https://aws.amazon.com/cli/"),
    a unified tool to manage your AWS services
-   [snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ "https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/"),
    a workflow management system to create reproducible and scalable
    data analyses

and many many more!

If you find a software program that you need is not yet available please
[let us know](https://github.com/hbs-rcs/hbsgrid-docs/discussions)
and we will try to install it for you.

The 2022.01 release also brings a huge number of application and package
updates, including:
