Our research computing environments are actively developed and
continuously improving. **Bug reports and feature requests are important
contributions to this project and are always welcome and encouraged!**
If you find that something doesn't work as expected, of if you have a
feature request, we want to know about it so we can fix or
improve it. 

There are three ways to connect with our support services:

- For administrative requests including project and account creation or modification 
please use our [request forms](../support/account-requests/).

- If you have a question or can't get something working you can post
to our [discussion
forum](https://github.com/hbs-rcs/hbsgrid-docs/discussions) or reach
out to us directly via email at
[research@hbs.edu](mailto:research@hbs.edu).

- If something looks broken or is not working as expected please 
[open an issue report](https://github.com/hbs-rcs/hbsgrid-docs/issues).
