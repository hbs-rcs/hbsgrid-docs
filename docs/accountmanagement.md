# New Account Management System

RCS, along with our IT partners, are excited to announce the upcoming replacement of our HBSGrid account and project space provisioning system effective **April 10, 2023**. This upgrade will significantly improve the speed, efficiency, and automation of creating and maintaining HBSGrid accounts and project spaces.

**What will change for users on April 10th?**
## New and Improved Forms
We will be retiring our old account and project space request forms. Instead, you will visit **URL** in order to:
1. request a new HBSGrid account
1. request a new HBSGrid project space
1. request access to an HBSGrid project space

To request more space in your project folder or to make other project space changes, you will need to contact RCS directly at <research@hbs.edu>.

## Streamlined HBSGrid Account and Project Space Approval Emails
HBSGrid guest accounts (i.e., accounts for users who do not have HBS credentials) and all HBSGrid project spaces must have an approved HBS sponsor, usually a faculty member. The new system makes it easier than ever for sponsors to approve account requests and project space members by simply clicking a link in an email. 

!!! info inline end "Sponsors"
    Faculty members may sponsor guest accounts and project spaces. 
    Doctoral students may also sponsor project spaces, but if the space 
    will include guest collaborators, the sponsor must be a faculty
    member or Jen Mucciarone.

### Guest HBSGrid Accounts
#### For Account Sponsors
When a guest user requests an account listing you as the sponsor, you will receive an automated email from `noreply@hbs.edu` with a link asking you to review and approve the request. Click the link to do so. If you do not approve or receive a request from a person you do not recognize, contact RCS at <research@hbs.edu>.

#### For Guest Users
After you submit a guest account request, you will receive an automated email from `noreply@hbs.edu` asking you to review and sign a Guest User Agreement. Click the link to do so. Please note that this link will expire in 5 days.

You must accept the agreement for your account to be created. Once the account is created, you will receive an encrypted automated email from `svc_ome@hbs.edu` containing your temporary HBSGrid password. **You may use this link only once and it expires in two weeks.** You will receive instructions to change your password and download our VPN software so that you can access the HBSGrid.
### Project Space Access
If a user requests access to a project space, the sponsor of that project space will receive an automated email from `noreply@hbs.edu` with a link asking you to click if you confirm. Click the link to add the person to the space. If you do not approve or receive a request from a person you do not recognize, contact RCS at <research@hbs.edu>.
