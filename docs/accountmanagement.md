# New Account Management System

RCS, along with our IT partners, are excited to announce the upcoming replacement of our HBSGrid account and project space provisioning system effective **April 10, 2023**. This upgrade will significantly improve the speed, efficiency, and automation of creating and maintaining HBSGrid accounts and project spaces.

**What will change for users on April 10th?**
## New and Improved Forms
We will be retiring our old account and project space request forms. Instead, you will use new forms to request new spaces and accounts:
*   Request a new HBSGrid account: **URL**
*   Request a new HBSGrid project space: **URL**
*   Request access to an HBSGrid project space: **URL**

To request more space in your project folder or to make other project space changes, you will need to contact RCS directly at <research@hbs.edu>.

## Streamlined HBSGrid Account and Project Space Approval Emails
HBSGrid guest accounts (i.e., accounts for users who do not have HBS credentials) and all HBSGrid project spaces must have an approved HBS sponsor, usually a faculty member. The new system makes it easier than ever for sponsors to approve account requests and project space members by simply clicking a link in an email. 

!!! info inline end "Sponsors"
    Faculty members may sponsor guest accounts and project spaces. 
    Doctoral students may also sponsor project spaces, but if the space 
    will include guest collaborators, the sponsor must be a faculty
    member or Jen Mucciarone.

### Guest HBSGrid Accounts
#### For Account Sponsors
When a guest user requests an account listing you as the sponsor, you will receive an automated email from `noreply@hbs.edu` with a link asking you to review and approve the request. Click the link to do so. If you do not approve or receive a request from a person you do not recognize, contact RCS at <research@hbs.edu>.

#### For Guest Users

You must accept the agreement for your account to be created. Once the account is created, you will receive an encrypted automated email from `svc_ome@hbs.edu` containing your temporary HBSGrid password. **You may use this link only once and it expires in two weeks.** You will receive instructions to change your password and download our VPN software so that you can access the HBSGrid.
### Project Space Access
When you have been added to a project space, new or old, you will receive an automated email from `noreply@hbs.edu` with the access information.
#### For Project Space Sponsors
If a user requests access to your project space, you will receive an automated email from `noreply@hbs.edu` with a link asking you to click if you confirm. Click the link to add the person to the space. If you do not approve or receive a request from a person you do not recognize, contact RCS at <research@hbs.edu>.
