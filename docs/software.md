# ðŸ“¦ Available software

A huge range of software applications, utilities, and libraries are
installed and configured for you. Whether you need *Rstudio* or
*Spyder*, *Julia* running in *VSCode*, popular R or Python packages,
of fully configured *Jupyter Notebooks*, we have you covered.

The list of installed software is so large we make no effort to
enumerate everything here, but you can always get an up-to-date list
by opening a *terminal* on the Grid and running
``` sh
conda list
```

**Start with the expectation that all the software you need is already
installed and ready to use**. If that expectation is ever broken please
put in a request using our [discussion forum](https://github.com/hbs-rcs/hbsgrid-docs/discussions)
or [issue tracker](https://github.com/hbs-rcs/hbsgrid-docs/issues).

The most recent version of our software environment is activated when you log 
in to the HBS Grid via *NoMachine* and nothing further is required in that case.

When logging in via *SSH* from a terminal (i.e., without *NoMachine*) you must 
explicitly activate the environment you wish to use after logging in. The default
environment can be activated by running `ml rcs`. Refer to the 
[terminal environment](environments.md#select-terminal-environment)
documentation for details.
