# **HBS [Research Computing Services](https://www.hbs.edu/research-computing-services) is building powerful and user-friendly tools and environments to bring the computing power of the HBS Grid to a wider community of HBS users. Our environments include a wide range of software including *Julia*, *Matlab*, *Python*, *R*,* Stata*, and hundreds of other popular programs**

The HBS Grid consists of many powerful computers connected by a fast
network and shared network storage. The computers in our cluster have
up to 1.4Tb of memory and up to 32 cores per machine. This networked
cluster of computers provides the backbone HBS's research computing
capabilities.

This powerful network of computers can be accessed via user-friendly
tools and environments, bringing the power of our computing cluster to
all HBS researchers. 

These environments are in active development and are currently
available as a *Technology Preview* for testing.

**User testing and project status**

We are currently conducting user testing and assessing the possibility
of making this software more widely available. The environment is
generally stable but the software documented here 
**remains a technology preview and any and all use is at your own risk**.

If you find that something doesn't work as expected, of if you have a
feature request, we would love to know about it so we can fix or improve
it. Bug reports and feature requests are important contributions to this
project and are always welcome and encouraged! You can either start a
discussion at <https://github.com/hbs-rcs/hbsgrid-docs/discussions> or create an issue
report at <https://github.com/hbs-rcs/hbsgrid-docs/issues>. We are building a
friendly and welcoming community of HBS Grid users and we invite you to
join us using the links above.
