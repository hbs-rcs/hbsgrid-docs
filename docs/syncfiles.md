# ðŸ”„ Copy and Sync Files

The HBS Grid is primarily used for data analysis, machine learning, data
wrangling, and data visualization. Usually this means that 
**you need to copy or sync your data to the HBS Grid in order to do your work**.


## Access local files from *NoMachine* login nodes

!!! info inline end ""
     
    This makes files accessible from the [login nodes](commandline.md#compute-cluster-basics) 
    but not from the [compute nodes](commandline.md#compute-cluster-basics). For that you need to 
    [copy your files to the HBS Grid](syncfiles.md#sync-data-fromto-local-storage).

NoMachine makes it easy to mount your local file system on the HBS Grid
login node. This is useful for reading documentation, scripts, and other
small files without needing to physically copy anything to the HBS Grid.

!!! example "Mount your local file system to the HBS Grid:"
     
    1.  Log in to the HBS Grid by using
        [NoMachine](https://www.nomachine.com/download-enterprise#NoMachine-Enterprise-Client")
        to connect to host `hbsgrid-nx.hbs.edu`.
    2.  Press *Ctrl-Alt-0* to open the NoMachine session menu.
    3.  Click *Devices*
    4.  Click *Connect a disk*.
    5.  Locate the disk you want to mount under Local disks and click on it.
    6.  click the *Connect* button to mount your local disk on the HBS Grid.

## Sync data from/to local storage

*NoMachine* file mounting is useful, but it has a major limitation;
**drives mounted via NoMachine are not accessible by applications running on HBS Grid compute nodes**. 
This means that you will usually want to copy or sync your data to the HBS Grid. 
The easiest way to do this for files on your local machine is to mount your 
local drive 
[as described above](syncfiles.md#access-local-files-from-nomachine-login-nodes), 
and then use *grsync* to sync files from the 
*NoMachine* mount to the HBS Grid.

Because you must physically copy data to the HBS Grid in order to access
it from the [compute nodes](commandline.md#overview), you
have to decide where to put it. There are three options: *home directory*, 
*project space*, or *scratch storage*.

<a name="storageoverview"></a>
!!! info "HBS Grid storage overview"
    
    A **home directory** was created at `/export/home/<group>/<username>` 
    when you requested your account. Your home folder has limited storage 
    capacity and is accessible only by you.
     
    **Project spaces** are directories that are shared and accessible by all
    HBS Grid users working on that project. You can request a new
    project space using the [new project space request form](https://www.hbs.edu/research-computing-services/help/online-requests.aspx)
    and you can request modifications to an existing project space using the
    [change request form](https://www.hbs.edu/research-computing-services/help/online-requests.aspx).
     
    **Scratch storage** is available at `/export/scratch`. It is appropriate only for temporary, 
    short-term storage. Files are not backed up and will be deleted after 60 days.
    Scratch storage is a shared resource accessible to all users on the HBS Grid;
    make sure you [set permissions on your files accordingly](worksafe.md).

Once you have decided where to store your files on the HBS Grid you can follow the steps below to transfer them.

!!! example "Sync data from your local machine to the HBS Grid"
    1.  Log in to the HBS Grid and connect your local drive using
        NoMachine [as described above](syncfiles.md#access-local-files-from-nomachine-login-nodes).
     
    2.  Identify the directory on the HBS Grid that you will copy your data
        too, creating it if needed.
     
    3.  From the HBS Grid desktop, open the
        grsync application.
     
    4.  Choose a source directory under the
        NoMachine mount and specify the target directory from step 2.
     
    5.  Click the
        run button in the upper-right corner of the
        grsync application.

Note that transferring many small files is much slower than transferring
a small number of large files. You may find it faster to compress
folders with many small files into `.zip` or `.tar` archives, transfer those, 
and decompress/extract them on the other end.

## Sync data from/to cloud storage (OneDrive,Dropbox etc.)

If your data is in cloud storage you may wish to sync it directly from
there. While the HBS Grid does not offer native *Dropbox*, *OneDrive*,
or other cloud storage clients, you can use `rclone` to perform on-demand 
data synchronization with all major cloud storage providers.

!!! example "Sync your data from a cloud provider to the HBS Grid:"

    1.  Log in to the HBS Grid and connect your local drive using
        *NoMachine* as described above.
     
    2.  Identify the directory on the HBS Grid that you will copy your data
        too, creating it if needed.
     
    3.  From the HBS Grid desktop, open the *rclone browser* application.
     
    4.  Click the *Config...* button and follow the prompts (only needed the first
        time).
     
    5.  Click the cloud storage icon in the *Remotes* tab and select the directory you wish to sync.
     
    6.  Specify the target directory from step 2 in the destination field.
