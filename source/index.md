Harvard Business School runs a computing cluster called the [HBS
Grid](https://www.hbs.edu/research-computing-services/resources/compute-cluster/).
As of Spring 2021 the HBS Grid has about 620 CPUs, 9 TB of RAM, 200 TB of
storage, and high-end GPUs useful for modern deep learning. HBS [Research
Computing Services](https://www.hbs.edu/research-computing-services) is building
powerful and user-friendly tools and environments to bring the computing power
of the HBS Grid to a wider community of HBS users. Our environments include a
wide range of software including Matlab, R, Python, Stata, and hundreds of other
popular programs. These environments are in active development and are currently
available as a *Technology Preview* for testing.

You can click the video thumbnail below to watch a short demonstration of our
software environment.

**User testing and project status**

We are currently conducting user testing and assessing the possibility
of making this software more widely available. The environment is
generally stable but the software documented here 
**remains a technology preview and any and all use is at your own risk**.

If you find that something doesn\'t work as expected, of if you have a
feature request, we would love to know about it so we can fix or improve
it. Bug reports and feature requests are important contributions to this
project and are always welcome and encouraged! You can either start a
discussion at <https://github.com/hbs-rcs/hbsgrid-docs/discussions> or create an issue
report at <https://github.com/hbs-rcs/hbsgrid-docs/issues>. We are building a
friendly and welcoming community of HBS Grid users and we invite you to
join us using the links above.
