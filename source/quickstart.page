    <p>It is our hope that this environment will be intuitive and user-friendly, and you are encouraged
    to start exploring the available software and tools. If you are doing real work you will probably
    want to refer to <link xref="syncfiles"/> to learn how to get your data onto the HBS Grid.
    Additional reference documentation is available if you need it, including the <link xref="menulaunch"/>
    and <link xref="commandline"/> sections.</p>

    <p> If you run into any problems please let us know by posting at
