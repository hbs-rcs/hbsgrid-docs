  <title>User Guide to HBS Grid Software Environments Technology Preview</title>
  
  <p>Harvard Business School runs a computing cluster called the
  <link href="https://www.hbs.edu/research-computing-services/resources/compute-cluster/">HBS Grid</link>.
  As of Spring 2021 the HBS Grid has about 620 CPUs, 9 TB of RAM, 200 TB of storage, and high-end
  GPUs useful for modern <em>deep learning</em>. HBS <link href="https://www.hbs.edu/research-computing-services">Research Computing Services</link>
  is building powerful and user-friendly tools and environments to bring the computing power of the HBS Grid
  to a wider community of HBS users. Our environments include a wide range of software including <app>Matlab</app>,
  <app>R</app>, <app>Python</app>, <app>Stata</app>, and hundreds of other popular programs. These
  environments are in active development and are currently available as a <em>Technology Preview</em> for testing.</p>

  <p> You can <em style="strong">click the video thumbnail below</em> to watch a short demonstration of our software environment.</p>

    <title>User testing and project status</title>
    <p>We are currently conducting user testing and assessing the possibility of making this software more widely available.
    The environment is generally stable but the software documented here remains <em>a technology preview</em> and
    <em>any and all use is at your own risk</em>.</p>

    <p>If you find that something doesn't work as expected, of if you have a feature request, we would love to know about it so we can
    fix or improve it. Bug reports and feature requests are important contributions to this project and are always welcome and encouraged! You can either
